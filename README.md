# KindPath Collective — Start Here

This is the simplest entry point into the KindPath ecosystem.

## What this is
A navigation hub and contribution on-ramp: where to begin, how to collaborate, and how the pieces fit together.

## Core repositories
- [Field Kit (whitepaper + appendices)](https://github.com/S4mu3lD4v1d/kindpath-fieldkit)
- [Pilot in a Box (how to run a pilot)](https://github.com/S4mu3lD4v1d/kindpath-pilot-in-a-box)
- [Website (public front door)](https://github.com/S4mu3lD4v1d/kindpath-website)
- [KPTH (core working repo)](https://github.com/S4mu3lD4v1d/KPTH)

## How to collaborate
- Use **Discussions** for questions, proposals, critique, and open-ended conversation:
  https://github.com/S4mu3lD4v1d/kindpath-starter/discussions
- Use **Issues** for trackable work items (bugs, tasks, specific change requests)
- Use **Pull Requests** for edits and improvements (small and evidence-led)

## Values
Regeneration over extraction. Truth without blame cycles. Respect for ancient knowledge + modern evidence.
