# KindPath Collective — Start Here

This is the simplest entry point into the KindPath ecosystem.

## What this is
A navigation hub and contribution on-ramp: where to begin, how to collaborate, and how the pieces fit together.

## Core repositories
- Field Kit (whitepaper + appendices)
- Pilot in a Box (how to run a pilot)
- Website (public front door)
- KPTH (core working repo)

## How to collaborate
- Use **Issues** for questions, proposals, and discussion
- Use **Pull Requests** for edits and improvements
- Keep contributions small, specific, and evidence-led

## Values
Regeneration over extraction. Truth without blame cycles. Respect for ancient knowledge + modern evidence.
